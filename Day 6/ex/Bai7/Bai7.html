        <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel "<span class="bluecolor-underline">Anthologist</span>", scrawls in the margin of Oliver's "<span class="bluecolor-underline">New and Selected Poems, Volume One.</span>" A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones—Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale—before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: “I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing.” Of her poems, he says, “They’re very simple. And yet each has something.”</p>
